Name

   pia â€” calculate the area of intersection of polygons

Synopsis

#include <pia.h>

   float pia_area ( const point_t *a,
                    size_t na,
                    const point_t *b,
                    size_t nb);

DESCRIPTION

   When passed a pair of polygons, specified as arrays of point_t (and
   their lengths), calculates their area of intersection.

   The method of calculation reduces the area integration to a boundary
   integration using Green's theorem; this is the same principle as is
   used in the planimeter.

RETURN VALUE

   Returns the area of intersection of the polygons as a float.

AUTHORS

   The design of the algorithm and its implementation for GCC is due to
   Norman Hardy (see Hardy's Cap Lore site for further details).

   This implementation in C99 is by J.J. Green.
